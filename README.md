# R Language

A language package for [R](http://www.r-project.org).

Forked from lee-dohm/language-r and originally imported
from [r.tmbundle](https://github.com/textmate/r.tmbundle).

## Status

The grammar has been updated and will now be maintained. Suggestions are
welcome.

The sissel syntax I put together makes use of the new grammar, see
https://atom.io/packages/sissel-syntax.
