unmaintained) which was imported from
[r.tmbundle](https://github.com/textmate/r.tmbundle).

welcome.

There is a community maintained fork of the language-r package, found at
https://github.com/REditorSupport/atom-language-r. I highly suggest looking over
their work.

After updating the R grammar, I put together an atom syntax built just for it,
https://atom.io/packages/sissel-syntax.
