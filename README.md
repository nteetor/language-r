# R Language

A language package for [R](http://www.r-project.org).

Forked from lee-dohm/language-r and originally imported
from [r.tmbundle](https://github.com/textmate/r.tmbundle).

## status

The grammar has been updated and will now be maintained. Suggestions are
welcome. 

## installation

I do not know if I can replace the language-r package hosted by
Atom. For now I suggest cloning this repo and installing the package
from the command line using `apm`. Hopefully I will have a better solution
for you in the future!

## license

[MIT](LICENSE.md)

## other

I put together an atom syntax which utilizes the new grammar,
https://atom.io/packages/sissel-syntax.
